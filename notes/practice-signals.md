# Extract the Summary from the Basic Signals Component

## Create a new component based on the stuff at the top:

```html
<div>
  <p>You have 99 Animals, and Your Score is 128</p>
</div>
```

- Make it so that it shows the actual number of animals on the list.
- Make it so that it shows their actual current golf score.

## On the Golf Score Component

**Extra Credit**

Hint: computed

Let's just assume the "par" is always four.

If the current score is at one less than par, display a message
on the golf score component that tells them they are close to par.
If they are at par (4) show a message that says "You Got Par"
if they are over par, show a message telling them they are over par.
